        <p class="lead">I am a hardworking and determined individual who constantly strives to improve myself — not only for my own growth but also for my family and the people around me.
           I began working two jobs at the young age of fifteen, demonstrating my diligence, adaptability, and strong work ethic. 
           Currently, I am a senior at Xavier University of Louisiana, where I continue to expand my knowledge and professional experience while pursuing my education. 
           My ultimate goal is to graduate college and build a better future for myself and my family.

      <p>
        I am deeply interested in web development and design, as I enjoy creating interactive and visually appealing websites that deliver a meaningful user experience. 
        As I work toward graduating from college, my goal is to obtain an internship that allows me to apply and expand my skills in real-world projects, laying the foundation for a successful career in technology. 
        I am also passionate about cryptocurrency and the ways blockchain technology is reshaping the digital landscape. 
        In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects—such as building websites or developing apps related to crypto and other innovative services—that help me explore new ideas, improve my technical abilities, and stay ahead of emerging trends in the tech world.
